# Demo Video Script (2-3 Minutes)

## Introduction (15-20 seconds)

**[Show both applications side by side]**

"Hello! I'm presenting the Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer - a hybrid web and desktop application built with Django, React, and PyQt5. This application allows chemical engineers to upload equipment data, visualize parameters, and generate comprehensive reports."

**[Quick overview of both interfaces]**

---

## Part 1: Web Application Demo (60-70 seconds)

### Upload & Analysis (20s)

**[Focus on web browser - http://localhost:3000]**

"Let's start with the web application. I'll upload a CSV file containing chemical equipment data."

**[Actions]:**
1. Click "Choose File"
2. Select `sample_equipment_data.csv`
3. Click "Upload & Analyze"

"The application processes the CSV file and immediately displays comprehensive analytics."

### Summary Statistics (15s)

**[Show summary section]**

"We can see the summary statistics including:
- Total equipment count
- Average flowrate, pressure, and temperature values"

### Visualizations (15s)

**[Scroll to charts]**

"The data is visualized using Chart.js with:
- A pie chart showing equipment type distribution
- A bar chart displaying average parameters"

### Data Table (10s)

**[Scroll to table]**

"All equipment details are presented in an easy-to-read table format."

### PDF Report (10s)

**[Click PDF button and show download]**

"We can generate a professional PDF report with all the analysis, perfect for documentation and sharing with team members."

## Part 2: Desktop Application Demo (50-60 seconds)

### Application Overview (15s)

**[Switch to PyQt5 desktop app]**

"Now let's look at the desktop application built with PyQt5. It provides the same functionality with a native desktop interface."

**[Show main window with tabs]**

"The interface is organized into tabs for easy navigation: Summary, Charts, Data Table, and History."

### Upload Process (15s)

**[Demonstrate upload]**

1. Click "Browse"
2. Select CSV file
3. Click "Upload & Analyze"

"The desktop app connects to the same backend API, ensuring data consistency across platforms."

### Tab Navigation (20s)

**[Navigate through tabs]**

"Let's explore the tabs:
- **Summary tab**: Shows statistics and PDF download option
- **Charts tab**: Matplotlib visualizations with pie and bar charts
- **Data Table tab**: Complete equipment listing
- **History tab**: Shows the last 5 uploaded datasets"

### History Feature (10s)

**[Click on History tab, click Load on a dataset]**

"The history feature allows us to quickly load and review previous analyses. I'll load an earlier dataset... and it instantly displays the data."

## Part 3: Cross-Platform Features (30-40 seconds)

### Authentication (15s)

**[Show login in either app]**

"Both applications support user authentication with login and registration functionality."

**[Optional: show quick login]**

### Data Synchronization (15s)

**[Show history in both apps]**

"Since both frontends connect to the same Django backend, data uploaded from the web app is immediately available in the desktop app, and vice versa."

**[Show same dataset in both]**

"Here you can see the same dataset visible in both applications."

### PDF Generation (10s)

**[Generate and show PDF briefly]**

"The PDF reports can be generated from either interface, providing professional documentation with all charts, tables, and statistics."
